This implementation is based on [RAHIL PARIKH's solution](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rprkh15/nlp-eda-bert#Preprocessing-the-Tweets).

This is an example Brane package for a preprocessing solution. Import it as follows:

```shell
$ brane import Han-Linnn/data_processing
```

For an usage of the function of the brane package, you can `test` the package
```shell
$ brane --debug test data_processing
```


You also need to push the package to be able to import it in your remote session or jupyterlab notebook:
```shell
brane push data_processing 1.0.0
```
